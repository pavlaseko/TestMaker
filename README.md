# Project Title

Project idea was to implement basic "Test Maker" app functionality, however it is a lot to do and to work with,
but for now it is great "Basic Authentication" project example to secure both frontend and backend.

Back-end uses [`Spring Boot`](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot) application called TestMaker
Front-end uses [`React`](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp) application called frontend

### Prerequisites

* You need to change application properties to your own database.
* Also you can turn of or minimise log file capacity, so it do not take your space much.
* Oh, and don't forget to check out that all dependencies has successfully been installed.


## Getting Started

You can use Database initializer to test the project or prepare your own database
it is already in this project.

1) Prepare your database
2) Start Environment
3) Run the following `Maven` command to start the application

### Installation

- **frontend**

    - Open  terminal and navigate to `frontend` folder;

    - Run the command below if you are running the application for the first time:
      ```
      npm install
      ```

    - Run the `npm` command below to start the application:
      ```
      npm start
      ```

## Applications URLs

| Application | URL                    | Credentials                                         |
|-------------|------------------------| --------------------------------------------------- |
| TestMaker   | http://localhost:8080  |                                                     |
| Frontend    | http://localhost:3000  | `admin/admin`, `user/user` or signing up a new user |

> **Note**: the credentials shown in the table are the ones already pre-defined. You can signup new users.


## Final thoughts
I am still working on this project with hope that it will become perfect example for those,
who just started their programming journey!
